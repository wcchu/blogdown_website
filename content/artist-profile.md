Dr. Wei-Chun Chu (Jubarly) is a Berlin-based visual artist. His art digs into different forms of interactions between light and materials, such as transmission, reflection, diffusion etc, in both realistic and abstract settings.

He studied physics and optics and worked in Taiwan, US, and Germany on the forefront fields of laser and fiber optics. The expression of his art is related strongly to the theme of motion, fluctuation, and the transient property of light.

He discovered his love for painting and drawing as a child, and went later to the private tutoring in Rembrandt Studio (Taipei, Taiwan) for oil and pastel techniques. He has been in several group exhibitions since 1999.

In the next few years, Jubarly will try to bring sci-fi scenes and abstract images--two seemingly incompatible disciplines--into his paintings. He intends to conduct optical experiments on the ground of the sci-fi story telling in a non-conventional way.

His new works will be updated in his Instagram account [Jubarly Studio](https://www.instagram.com/jubarlystudio).
