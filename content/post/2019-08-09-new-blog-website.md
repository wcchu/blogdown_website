This website is a blog for my activities in physics, visual art, music, data science, and more. I intend to connect my projects/art works/writings that are scattered among different social sites together using this blog.

The repository https://github.com/wcchu/blogdown_website contains the codes to create this website using R blogdown and Hugo. I've chosen the Hugo theme "Casper" (https://themes.gohugo.io/casper/) for its simplistic design and easy configuration. The inspiration also came from the R blogdown demonstration written by Corrie Bartelheimer, a data scientist that I met in satRday Berlin (https://berlin2019.satrdays.org/).

For a general guide to R blogdown, see https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/. Corrie's article about R blogdown is in https://www.samples-of-thoughts.com/post/how-to-make-a-website-using-blogdown-and-github/.
