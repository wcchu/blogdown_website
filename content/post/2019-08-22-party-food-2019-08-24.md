Fenway and I hosted a house party the past Saturday evening. We prepared a light meal with vegetarian and meat dishes for our guests. We made a eggplant-zucchini pizza, a mushroom quiche, a watermellon salad, chocolate cookies, and a cauliflower chowder. Some boiled chicken was prepared optionally for the cauliflower chowder. Except the soup, which was vegan or meat depending on the chicken, everything else was vegetarian. We had 2 vegetarians out of 7 guests. It's a good combination of dishes for this diverse crowd. The following are the ingredients and the picture of each dish:
