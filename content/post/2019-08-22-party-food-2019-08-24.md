Fenway and I hosted a house party yesterday evening. We prepared a light meal with vegetarian and meat dishes for our guests. We made a eggplant-zucchini pizza, a mushroom quiche, a watermellon salad, chocolate cookies, and a cauliflower chowder. Some boiled chicken was prepared on the side for the cauliflower chowder. Except the soup, which was vegan or meat depending on the chicken, everything else was vegetarian. We had 2 vegetarians out of 7 guests. It's a good food combination for this diverse crowd.
